# WarpLink

WarpLink is [OpenC3 COSMOS](https://docs.openc3.com/docs) configured as the
ground system for WarpOS flight software. It provides telemetry display and
graphing, command sending, scripting, logging, CFDP file transfer, and
simulation control for one or more WarpOS build targets over UDP, serial/USB,
or TCP/IP.

## Repository layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `CosmosUpdateCmdTlm.py` | Generates COSMOS command/telemetry definitions from a WarpOS `cmd_tlm.json` |
| `templates/` | CCSDS header templates (`command.txt`, `telemetry.txt`) and bare CFDP PDU templates (`cfdp_command.txt`, `cfdp_telemetry.txt`) the generator fills in |
| `openc3-cosmos-warplink/` | The COSMOS plugin: `plugin.txt`, per-target `cmd_tlm/`, and the built `.gem` files |
| `openc3-cosmos-warplink/targets/common/` | `target.txt` and `lib/` (CFDP-aware CRC, `check_pattern.py`, half-float conversion) copied into every generated target |
| `openc3-cosmos-warplink/microservices/CFDP_SERVICE/` | CFDP file transfer microservice |
| `openc3-cosmos-init/plugins/packages/openc3-cosmos-tool-simcontrol/` | The Sim Control tool |
| `openc3-cosmos-init/plugins/packages/openc3-cosmos-tool-cfdpuplink/` | The CFDP Uplink tool |
| `compose.yaml` | Container configuration, including the telemetry ports published into COSMOS |
| `bridge.txt` | Windows serial/USB bridge configuration, run with `openc3cli bridge bridge.txt` |
| `cfdp/` | Host directory for CFDP transfers (git-ignored, bind mounted into the containers) |
| `openc3.sh` | Container control and CLI wrapper |

Everything else is upstream OpenC3 COSMOS.

## Setup

1. Clone WarpLink from the GitHub distribution:
   <https://github.com/warpware-distribution/warplink>

2. **Generate the cmd/tlm files.** From within WarpOS, go to the `build`
   directory and run `cmake ..`

   1. This creates `cmd_tlm.json` in the build directory.
   2. Copy that file into the base directory of WarpLink.
   3. From the base directory, run `python3 CosmosUpdateCmdTlm.py`

   The generator reads the `cosmos_target` field in the JSON and writes
   everything that target needs:

   - `openc3-cosmos-warplink/targets/<TARGET>/cmd_tlm/cmd.txt` and `tlm.txt`
   - `target.txt` and `lib/` copied from `targets/common/`
   - a `TARGET` + `INTERFACE` block in `openc3-cosmos-warplink/plugin.txt`, on
     the next free pair of UDP ports and pointed at `host.docker.internal`
     (override with `--plugin-host`), if that target is not declared yet

   Each WarpOS build gets its own COSMOS target, so several builds can coexist
   in one instance. Blocks that already exist in `plugin.txt` are never
   rewritten — ports and hosts you tune there survive regeneration. Run
   `python3 CosmosUpdateCmdTlm.py --help` for the available paths and flags.

   The generator does not edit `compose.yaml`. For a new target, publish its
   read port there too — see [Targets and ports](#targets-and-ports).

3. **Build and start the containers.**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p cfdp       # CFDP transfer directory; create it before Docker does, as root
   ./openc3.sh start   # builds the containers from this source, then runs them
   ./openc3.sh run     # afterwards: runs the already-built containers
   ```

   WarpLink's containers include the CFDP Uplink and Sim Control tools, so they
   are built from this repository rather than pulled as upstream OpenC3 images.
   Run `./openc3.sh start` again after updating to a new WarpLink release.

4. **Build the plugin** that ingests the commands and telemetry:

   ```bash
   cd openc3-cosmos-warplink/ && ../openc3.sh cli rake build VERSION=1.0.0
   ```

   1. Increment the version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) on every build — COSMOS keys
      plugins by version, so reinstalling requires a new number.
   2. This creates `openc3-cosmos-warplink-#.#.#.gem` in that directory, used
      in the next steps.

5. In a web browser, open <http://localhost:2900/> — this is the WarpLink GUI.

6. **Install the plugin.** From the Admin Console, select "Install from file"
   and choose the `.gem` you just built. The install dialog lists every
   `VARIABLE` in `plugin.txt` (each target's enable flag, host, and ports), so
   connection settings can be changed here without editing the file.

7. Depending on your setup, follow the UDP, Linux Serial/USB, or Windows
   Serial/USB instructions below for connecting to the telemetry stream.

### Rebuilding after a change

Any change to `plugin.txt`, `cmd.txt`, `tlm.txt`, or the target `lib/` needs a
new gem: rebuild with an incremented `VERSION` and reinstall it through the
Admin Console. Regenerating from a new `cmd_tlm.json` (step 2) counts.

A change to `compose.yaml` needs `./openc3.sh run` to recreate the affected
containers; it does not need a new gem.

## Targets and ports

Each target needs its own UDP ports. COSMOS scopes packet identification to the
targets mapped to the receiving interface, and the WarpOS builds reuse the same
STREAM_IDs, so two targets sharing an interface — or two interfaces sharing a
read port — cannot be told apart. `CosmosUpdateCmdTlm.py` allocates above the
highest port already declared to keep new targets clear of existing ones.

Defaults in `openc3-cosmos-warplink/plugin.txt`:

| Target | Enabled | Host | Write (command) | Read (telemetry) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BF2_FLIGHT_BOARD` | yes | `host.docker.internal` | 5006 | 5005 |
| `SIM` | no | `host.docker.internal` | 5009 | — (send only) |

Targets generated from other WarpOS builds are added on the next free pair of
ports above these (5010/5011, then 5012/5013, and so on).

Set `<target>_enable` to `true` or `false`, in the file or in the install
dialog, to choose which targets load.

**Publishing ports.** COSMOS receives telemetry inside the `openc3-operator`
container, so every enabled target's read port must be listed under that
service's `ports` in `compose.yaml`. Only `BF2_FLIGHT_BOARD`'s 5005 is there by
default; a generated target on 5010 needs `- "0.0.0.0:5010:5010/udp"`. Publish only read
ports. Write ports are outbound from the container and need no mapping, and
publishing one makes any host process that has to bind that port (a splitter
or a simulator) fail with `EADDRINUSE`.

## Windows Serial/USB Command/Telemetry Interface

To run WarpLink over serial/USB on Windows, a "Bridge" is needed to connect the
data arriving on the host machine's COM port to the Docker instance running
under the hood.

Downloads needed:

- Download Ruby (v3.2+) from the official Ruby website.
- From PowerShell, run `gem install openc3`
  - Ensure the Ruby gem executable path is in your `PATH` environment variable.

Configuration:

- `bridge.txt` in the base directory of WarpLink configures the bridge. Check
  its variables against your hardware:
  - UART configuration — baud rate (default 230400), parity, data bits, flow
    control, etc.
  - COM port name (default `COM4`) — the port you read and write depends on
    what your computer assigned the USB connection; see Device Manager
  - Router port (default 5000) — the TCP port the bridge serves serial traffic
    on for COSMOS to connect to
- In `openc3-cosmos-warplink/plugin.txt`, each target block has a commented
  `INTERFACE` line for a TCP connection to `host.docker.internal`. Uncomment
  that line for your target and comment out its other `INTERFACE` lines (serial
  and UDP). For `BF2_FLIGHT_BOARD` it already connects on port 5000 for both
  directions; if you change `router_port` in `bridge.txt`, change both ports on
  that line to match.
  - Changing `plugin.txt` means rebuilding the `.gem` and reinstalling it
    through the UI, per the instructions above.

Once the new gem is uploaded and the routing device is plugged in, run the
bridge:

- From PowerShell: `openc3cli bridge bridge.txt`
- Expect a couple of outputs in the terminal. You will know it succeeded on
  `SERIAL_ROUTER: Tcpip server accepted from host.docker.internal(...)`

## Linux Serial/USB Connection

To connect to a serial/USB device on Linux, configure `plugin.txt`. Each target
block has a commented line for `openc3/interfaces/serial_interface.py`. Uncomment
it and comment out that target's other `INTERFACE` lines. Its options are, in
order:

- Write port
- Read port
- Baud rate
- Parity
- Stop bits
- Write timeout
- Read timeout

Ensure the serial configuration matches your hardware, and that the read/write
ports (default `/dev/ttyUSB0`) match the USB/serial device you have plugged in.

- Changing `plugin.txt` means rebuilding the `.gem` and reinstalling it through
  the UI, per the instructions above.

## Using a Raspberry Pi for command/telemetry

The simplest way to receive telemetry is over WiFi using a RasPi. You can
either:

1. Use the Raspberry Pi as a passthrough for telemetry.
   1. Connect the telemetry and command UARTs from the hardware to the Pi.
   2. Copy `cmd-tlm-interface.py` from the pi-tools repository
      (`attx-engineering/pi-tools`) to the Pi.
   3. Run it with the flags for your setup (see step 9 below). Telemetry
      should start passing through.
2. Use the Raspberry Pi as the hardware platform, configured to take telemetry
   and send it over a socket.

**Notes:**

1. The Pi must send to the read port and listen on the write port of the target
   it is feeding (5005/5006 for `BF2_FLIGHT_BOARD`; see
   [Targets and ports](#targets-and-ports)).
2. That target's `<target>_host` variable must be the IP of the Pi. Set it in
   `openc3-cosmos-warplink/plugin.txt`, or in the plugin install dialog, which
   needs no rebuild.

### RasPi configuration for Serial-UDP

> **Note:** the Raspberry Pi option is only used if you are routing commands and
> telemetry through a Pi so your ground station can send and receive over UDP.

If the RasPi hasn't been flashed yet:

1. Download the RPi Imager.
2. Plug the SD card into your computer.
3. Configure:
   1. Operating System: RPi OS 64-bit
   2. Storage: internal SD card reader (or whatever your SD card interface is)
   3. Settings (gear icon):
      1. Set the hostname to your liking
      2. Check "enable SSH" and "Use password authentication"
      3. Choose a username
      4. Configure wireless LAN for your network, and check the password
   4. Click "Write", then "Yes"
4. Once the write completes and the dialog says it is safe, unplug the SD card
   and transfer it to the RasPi.
5. Plug in the USB-C power supply.
6. Wait for the onboard LED to blink green.
7. From a separate computer on the same network: `ssh <hostname>.local`
   1. If the connection does not work, try pinging the Pi.
   2. On first boot the RasPi may need to connect to WiFi, so allow ~10 minutes
      before troubleshooting.
8. Transfer `cmd-tlm-interface.py` to the RasPi (VSCode remote-ssh extension,
   SFTP, or another method).
9. On the RasPi CLI, run it with the flags for your hardware and network:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 cmd-tlm-interface.py --udp_addr <WarpLink host IP> \
       --telemetry_serial <USB serial> --command_serial <USB serial>
   ```

   | Flag | Meaning | Default |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `--udp_addr` | IP of the machine running WarpLink | — |
   | `--udp_port` | Target read port telemetry is sent to | 5005 |
   | `--listen_port` | Target write port commands arrive on | 5006 |
   | `--telemetry_serial` | USB serial number of the telemetry UART adapter | `BG00WUKH` |
   | `--command_serial` | USB serial number of the command UART adapter | `BG01BA7H` |
   | `--baud` | UART baud rate | 115200 |
   | `--telemetry_baud` | Telemetry UART baud rate, if different from `--baud` | same as `--baud` |

   `find-usb-devices.py` in pi-tools can help identify the adapters' serial
   numbers. Once it is running, telemetry should appear on the CmdTlmServer
   tab in WarpLink.

## Simulation control

The `SIM` target is not a WarpOS build. It is a send-only JSON channel on its
own port (5009 by default) so it never mixes with flight software command
traffic. It is disabled by default; set `sim_enable` to `true` to load it. Its
one command, `SET_VALUE`, sends raw JSON with no CCSDS header and no CRC:

```json
{ "address": ".exc.spacecraft.params.mass", "value": 5 }
```

The Sim Control tool in the sidebar is the front end for it. To autocomplete
addresses, load the `graph_tree.json` the simulation writes on its first step
into the tool. The tool keeps the tree in your browser, so loading a newer dump
needs no plugin rebuild.

The port is fire-and-forget: "Sent" means the JSON left WarpLink, not that the
simulation accepted it. A rejected address or value is logged on the
simulation's side only.

## CFDP file transfer

Files move between WarpLink and WarpOS as unacknowledged-mode CFDP transfers,
carried as bare CFDP PDUs (no CCSDS wrapper) on the target's normal interface.

- **Definitions.** Packets marked `"packing_scheme": "cfdp"` in `cmd_tlm.json`
  are generated from `templates/cfdp_telemetry.txt` (always named
  `CFDP_PACKET`) and `templates/cfdp_command.txt`
  (`STORAGE_MANAGER_CFDP`). Every interface uses `check_pattern.py 512`, which
  delineates both CCSDS packets and CFDP PDUs, and `cfdp_aware_crc_protocol.py`,
  which skips the CRC fill on the bare PDU commands.
- **Service.** `CFDP_SERVICE` serves the one target named by the `cfdp_target`
  plugin variable (default `BF2_FLIGHT_BOARD`). Set `cfdp_enable` to `false` to
  install without it.
- **Receiving.** Files are staged in `cfdp/incoming/in_progress/` and moved to
  `cfdp/incoming/complete/` only once every byte has arrived and the checksum
  matches; anything else lands in `cfdp/incoming/failed/`. Partial files have
  their missing bytes zero-filled and a `<name>.cfdp-status.json` beside them
  recording bytes received, missing ranges, and why the transfer is not
  complete.
- **Sending and requesting.** The CFDP Uplink tool in the sidebar uploads a
  file and queues it for `CFDP_SERVICE` to send, sends
  `STORAGE_MANAGER_FILE_GET` to request a file from WarpOS, and lists and
  downloads received files — including partial ones, each labelled Complete,
  Receiving, Incomplete, or Failed. Uploading requires the admin role.

The `cfdp/` directory must exist before the containers start, or Docker creates
it owned by root and the service cannot write to it.

## Troubleshooting

Most of the time, disconnecting and reconnecting (via the "Action" column on the
CmdTlmServer tab) or rebuilding and reinstalling the plugin is enough.

1. If no data appears in the GUI and there are no recurring messages on the
   CmdTlmServer page:
   1. Check that the Raspberry Pi is actually sending UDP data — verify the IP
      address, baud rate, and serial port on the Pi.
   2. Ensure the IP addresses and ports are correct in
      `openc3-cosmos-warplink/plugin.txt`, or in the plugin install dialog.
   3. Check that the target's `<target>_enable` variable is `true`.
   4. Check that the target's read port is published in `compose.yaml` — see
      [Targets and ports](#targets-and-ports).
2. If many "unknown" packets are arriving, the definitions no longer match the
   flight software. Reload `cmd_tlm.json` from WarpOS, copy it into WarpLink,
   rerun `CosmosUpdateCmdTlm.py`, and rebuild and reinstall the `.gem`.
3. If a target loads but never identifies packets while another target works,
   check that the two are not sharing a read port — see
   [Targets and ports](#targets-and-ports).
4. If a host-side splitter or simulator fails to start with `EADDRINUSE`, a
   write port is published in `compose.yaml`. Remove that mapping and run
   `./openc3.sh run`.
